# PR Reviewer (Modular UI) — GitHub PR & File‑History Reviews via LLM 

A desktop (Tkinter) app to:
- Fetch a GitHub Pull Request (PR) diff, run **multiple LLMs in parallel**, and synthesize a concise, actionable **HTML review report**.
- Browse repos/PRs, filter by author/title/status, and keep a **local history** of generated reviews.
- Generate **curated file‑history summaries** across multiple commits for a single file—each commit rendered as an HTML table with “Change Summary” and “Likely Reasons”.

> Works with an OpenAI‑compatible gateway (e.g., **Dell AIA Gateway**) using either a **preissued bearer token** or **client‑credentials (aia_auth)** flow. Supports GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise.

### 🛠️ Steps Overview
1. Request access to Dell Digital Cloud via the internal onboarding process.
2. Obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret` from the AIA portal.
3. Use these credentials to generate an access token via the AIA authentication flow.
4. Configure your environment or application to use the token when calling models.
